;;; dynsite.el --- Configure and manage orgmode publishing projects. 

;;; Commentary:

;; Building the projects definitions to work with (the sites are made later based on these):
;; org-build-projects: Construct and store all project defs in org-publish-project-alist
;; Help on using this publish setup is found in file org-publish-help.org, in the same folder
;; as the present setup file

;; Overview: 
;; org-site-root contains the path to the root directory containing all  org-sites
;; org-site-html contains the path for publishing sites in html
;; org-publish-regexp is the expression for replacing the base path with the html publish path
;; org-config-file-data is the list of data for building the plist of each project
;; org-project-def-files finds all folders containing config.org files under org-site-root.
;; org-project-def-lists list of project paths together with containing superprojects paths. 
;; org-project-defs is an assoc list containing a project definition for each project path.

;; DONE: 
;; - modify plist generation to use org nodes only, no #+ single line headers
;; - single line properties should be indicated by propertyname: property in the node heading
;; - construct origin and target folder property for each project
;; - construct filetype property for each project (given in template?)
;; - add default heading and other properties in project plist def
;; - construct folder exclude property for each project
;; - add subfolder projects to exclude regexp for each project
;; - (DEBUG:) sort super/subfolders so that inheritance of properties is correct
;; - add mechanism to permit multiple projects with same folder names
;;   Suggestion: just concat the names of the superfolders for all projects, 
;;   in reverse order.  Examples:
;;   org (top level project) 
;;   subfolder1/org (subproject of top level project)
;;   subsubfolder1/subfolder1/org (subproject of subproject of top level project)
;;   This way the name of the project reflects its full identity!
;;   Add mechanism for inserting paths relative to the root of the project
;;   at any point in the html file, by marking the root of the project as {{.}}
;; - Add all website .org files of org directory to org-refile-targets
;;   for access of their org nodes via autocomplete. 
;;   This is coded in interactive function org-publish-add-all-files-to-refile-targets
;; - Create sitemap sitemap.org
;; - Utility function for editing all configs: org-publish-edit-all-configs
;; - construct rsync or git shell commands for uploading published projects
;;   Done: a single function for rsyncing the entire folder. 
;; - construct media copy projects and link them to each html export project
;;   use the three project mechanism described in: 
;;   http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html#sec-3
;; - Create function for touching all files in org folder, to force re-export
;;   The interactive function is org-reset-all-project-files
;;   it uses: (shell-command "find /Users/iani/org/* -exec touch {} \\;")
;; - Create global project "all" to publish all projects.
;; - defvar org-site-url to customize rsync upload method 
;; - defvar org-sites assoc list to store different site configurations
;;   These consist of : (name org-site-root org-site-html org-site-url)
;; - defun org-choose-site to switch
