DynSite is an extension of the html publishing scheme of orgmode in Emacs, which simplifies the way that multiple projects with different configurations are defined for one or many websites. 

See [[./dynsite-help.org]] and [[./dynsite-command-reference.org]] and [[./project-properties.org]] for documentation.
