* Dynsite help files

DynSite is an extension of the html publishing scheme of orgmode in Emacs, which simplifies the way that multiple projects with different configurations are defined for one or many websites. 

See [[./dynsite-help.org]] and [[./dynsite-command-reference.org]] and [[./project-properties.org]] for documentation. 

The full source and documentation is found at: https://github.com/iani/dynsite.

Here is a link to a page in a subfolder of this project: [[./test_subfolder/test_file.org]]. 
The file will render with the same css as those files placed in the root folder. 

Here is a link to a page contained in a subproject which has a different author and website name, but shares the same css or other parameters with the top-level project: [[./subproject/index.org]].
